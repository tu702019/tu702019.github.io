# Map, Food, Smiles


## Map

I was born in Tainan, a historic city in southern Taiwan. 
I studied Accounting at National Taiwan University and began my career as an auditor at PwC Taiwan. 
Later, I pursued a master's degree in Finance at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.

## Smiles

Music brings me joy, and I love listening to Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Gracie Abrams, and Clairo. 
I also find comfort and inspiration in anime.
